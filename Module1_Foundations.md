Module 1 Notes: Foundations of AI & AI Security

🔍 What I Learned

AI vs ML vs Deep Learning:

AI is the broad concept of machines simulating human intelligence.

Machine ** Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI focused on training models from data.

Deep Learning is ML using neural networks — it supercharges ML with more depth and complexity.

Why AI Security Matters:

AI now powers systems that affect millions of lives — hiring, medical decisions, law enforcement.

If it fails, or is manipulated, it causes real harm.

Protecting AI systems is as critical as building them.

🧠 Reflections

I used to think AI security was all math and code. Now I realize it’s part psychology, part red teaming, and part war-game.

This is more than just keeping software safe — it’s about keeping power accountable.

🚀 Takeaway

“If you can understand how a system learns — you can understand how it breaks.”

This module set the stage. I now see why AI security is the future — and I’m locked in.
