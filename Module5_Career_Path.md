# 🧭 Module 5 Notes: Career + Red Team Path

## 🔍 What I Learned

- **Red Teaming = Ethical Offense:** You simulate attacks before the bad guys do — then help patch the holes.
- **Prompt Engineering & Threat Simulation:** These are real skills companies need *right now*, especially with LLMs everywhere.
- **Policy + Ethics:** Understanding the impact of AI helps lawmakers and developers stay aligned as tech evolves fast.

## 🧠 Reflections

- I’m not waiting for a degree or permission — I’m building real skill, right now, through consistent learning and applied practice.
- Red teaming blends psychology, curiosity, and technical edge. That’s my lane.

## 🚀 Takeaway

> “The red team protects the future by challenging the present.”

I see now that this isn’t just a study path — it’s a calling. I’ve gone from curious to confident. And I’m not stopping here.
