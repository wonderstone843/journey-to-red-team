# 🎯 Microsoft SC-900 Security, Compliance, and Identity — Self-Taught Red Team Training

## 🧠 Overview
This repo documents my journey through the full **Microsoft SC-900** learning path — focused on **Security, Compliance, and Identity (SCI)** — using **free resources only**, without paying for formal certification. Instead of stopping at theory, I applied what I learned through **real-world red team projects and adversarial AI prompt testing**.

> 🚫 No tuition.  
> 🔐 No guessing.  
> ✅ Just skill.

## 📌 Why I Didn't Pay for Certification

While the SC-900 exam costs **$99**, I chose instead to:
- **Demonstrate real understanding** through public proof of learning
- Focus on **red team relevance**, not just passing a multiple choice test
- Show that **self-directed AI-assisted education** is the future of training
