# 🧰 Module 4 Notes: Tools & Defensive Techniques

## 🔍 What I Learned

- **TextAttack:** A tool for testing language models against adversarial prompts.
- **IBM ART:** Robust library for attacking and defending models across image, text, and tabular data.
- **Microsoft Counterfit:** Simulates black-box attacks on AI systems to test real-world vulnerabilities.
- **Monitoring Techniques:** Rate limiting, audit logging, anomaly detection, and content filtering.

## 🧠 Reflections

- Using these tools made threats feel *real* — it’s one thing to read about them, another to watch a model get fooled.
- Simulation is powerful. I saw how even small tweaks to input could flip an AI’s response.
- Good defense isn’t just blocking — it’s about adapting faster than the threat.

## 🚀 Takeaway

> “Tools sharpen instincts. Simulation builds muscle.”

Hands-on work with these tools gave me real insight into how red teamers test, and how defenders stay a step ahead.
