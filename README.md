# 🛡️ AI Security Journey — Self-Taught Red Teamer in Training

Welcome. I’m training to become a Red Team Analyst and AI Safety professional through self-guided study, real-world examples, and open-source tools. This repo tracks my progress, reflections, and threat simulations as I learn to protect AI systems from the ground up.

## 📚 Modules Completed

**Module 1: Foundations of AI & AI Security**

* Learned the difference between AI, ML, and Deep Learning
* Studied why securing AI matters in real-world systems

**Module 2: Threats to AI Systems**

* Adversarial attacks, data poisoning, model extraction, prompt injection
* Learned how to attack like a red teamer and defend like a blue teamer

**Module 3: Securing the ML Pipeline**

* Secured training, evaluation, and deployment stages
* Applied threat modeling and live monitoring practices

**Module 4: Tools & Defensive Techniques**

* Hands-on experience with:

  * TextAttack (NLP adversarial testing)
  * ART (image/text/tabular attack testing)
  * Counterfit (simulating black-box attacks)
* Learned how to detect, rate-limit, and monitor live models

**Module 5: Career + Red Team Path**

* Created portfolio plan
* Learned about roles in red teaming, AI policy, and AI bias auditing
* Wrote and answered my own job-focused prompts

## 🗣️ Why This Matters

I believe AI security is one of the most important frontiers of our time. Models that decide who gets hired, arrested, or heard must be stress-tested by ethical minds. I’m learning to become one of those minds because I believe this journey will eventually intersect with the emergence of superintelligence. My mission is to help make the line between tool and threat as solid and unbreakable as the Earth’s crust — rooted in ethics, foresight, and resilience.

## 🛡️ My Goal

To join a red team or AI safety role where I can ethically test systems, detect risks, and make AI safer for everyone.
